The below docs are from pre-Qt 5.14 times and are now very out of date.<br>
Starting with Qt 6.6 all this is no longer relevant - the QRhi APIs are now semi-public, with their entire documentation being part of the regular Qt documentation set.<br>
See for example <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtgui-overview.html#rhi-graphics">the QtGui module overview</a>.
<br><br>
<a href="qtrhi/qtrhi-index.html">qdoc-generated documentation for QRhi.</a> Currently matches patch set 73 of <a href="https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qtbase/+/256713">https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qtbase/+/256713</a>
with some upcoming compute shader related work on top.
